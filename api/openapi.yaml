        Start a FADE (FUBAR Approach to Directional Evolution) job. FADE is a fast method to test  whether or not a subset of sites in a protein alignment evolve towards a particular residue  along a subset of branches at accelerated rates compared to reference model. FADE uses a  random effects model and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) - inspired approximation methods  to allocate sites to rate classes.
